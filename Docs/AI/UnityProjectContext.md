## Project summary

`Defender_Of_Independence_Remake` is the clean Unity project for rebuilding the educational desktop game. The current URP project contains the menu/gallery foundation, a playable Level 1 hostage-rescue loop, Fungus cutscenes for Levels 1 and 2, and a Level 2 house/environment kit. The museum migration is sourced from `GameDevelopment2Assignment`, but unrelated senior-project scenes and systems should not be copied.

## Confirmed environment

- Unity Editor: 6000.5.0f1 (`88b47c5e7076`)
- Render pipeline: Universal Render Pipeline 17.5.0
- Input: Input System 1.19.0; Active Input Handling is now set to Both so the copied legacy-input museum controller and Starter Assets can coexist
- Cinemachine: 3.1.7
- glTFast: 6.19.0, used for the counter-terrorist glTF asset and selected to match the project's installed Burst version
- AI Navigation: 2.0.14, used by the Level 1 `NavMeshSurface` and enemy `NavMeshAgent` movement
- Target: desktop game; no platform build target was verified during onboarding

Sources: `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt`, `ProjectSettings/GraphicsSettings.asset`, `ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings.asset`, `Packages/manifest.json`, `Packages/packages-lock.json`.

## Structure and assemblies

- `Assets/Scene`: authored scenes
- `Assets/Script`: first-party scripts
- `Assets/Starter Assets`: Unity Starter Assets samples and runtime code
- `Assets/Font`, `Assets/Material`, `Assets/Prefab`: existing authoring folders
- `Unity.StarterAssets`: main runtime assembly; references the Input System
- `Unity.StartAssets.Editor` and `URPWizard`: editor-only Starter Assets assemblies
- Other first-party scripts currently compile into Unity's default project assembly
- `Assets/Script/Level1/Player`: first-person input, weapon, HUD, interaction, and damage-extension components
- `Assets/Script/Level1/Combat`: shared player/enemy health and target-display components
- `Assets/Script/Level1/Enemy`: attack, defend, retreat, spawning, aiming-pose, and world-health-bar components
- `Assets/Level1/Prefabs/Player/LevelOnePlayer.prefab`: generated, Inspector-editable Level 1 player
- `Assets/Level1/Prefabs/Enemy/LevelOneEnemy.prefab`: generated, Inspector-editable Terrorist enemy using the shared pistol
- `Assets/Level2/Art`: imported house, furniture, radio, and clock FBX/texture sources plus generated URP materials
- `Assets/Level2/Prefabs`: the house, 40 individually placeable furniture pieces, and progression prop prefabs

## Scenes and startup flow

- The current flow is `Scene_MainMenu` → `Cutscene_Level1` → `Scene_Level1` → `Cutscene_Level2` → `Scene_Level2`.
- `Scene_Level1` opens on a paused, scrollable instruction panel. START MISSION enables player controls and begins the initial enemy wave.
- `Cutscene_Level2` contains seven Fungus dialogue beats and loads `Scene_Level2` after its final Space prompt.
- `Scene_Level2` contains the imported interior house at the origin under `Level 2 Environment`, the user's room decoration, and a model-less WASD/mouse first-person player under `Level 2 Gameplay`. Three C-interaction doors use paired Enter/Exit markers and a black fade transition. The player exposes `ReturnToInitialSpawn()` for the future day-skip flow.
- The senior project's requested source scene was the misspelled `Assets/Scene/Meuseum.unity`; its working-tree version was the migration source.

## Architecture and conventions

The remake is early-stage and has no established gameplay architecture beyond Starter Assets. Prefer feature folders, Inspector-assigned references, serialized tuning values, and small components. Do not import unrelated senior-project systems merely to satisfy a scene reference.

## Testing and tooling

- Unity Test Framework is available transitively, but no first-party EditMode or PlayMode tests were found.
- Unity 6000.5.0f1 is installed locally.
- No Unity MCP capability was available in this task.
- Because the user's source and destination projects were open in Unity, the final migrated project was copied to an isolated validation directory and opened with Unity 6000.5.0f1 in batch mode. Compilation and the museum migration/validation utility completed successfully.
- A standalone player build has not yet been run. Focused automated Play Mode smoke checks exist for the Level 1 enemy spawn/navigation and damage/game-over paths; final hands-on input and visual checks remain appropriate in the Editor.
- The Level 1 player setup utility completed in an isolated project copy and validated the player at the authored `PlayerSpawnPoint`, including the camera, input actions, weapon controller, and five shadows-only character renderers.
- After the saved scene lost its enemy director, a repair utility reproduced the zero-enemy failure and restored only the missing wiring. The AI Navigation 2.0.14 `NavMeshSurface` baked 1,077 vertices; `EnemySpawnPoint` projected vertically from `(-4.88, 1.02, -13.89)` to `(-4.88, 0.92, -13.89)` with no horizontal displacement. A Play Mode smoke check confirmed exactly five living enemies spawned on the surface. Player and Enemy layers are configured not to collide with each other.
- The Level 1 damage/game-over pass compiled and ran in an isolated Unity project. A Play Mode smoke check applied 7.5 damage to both teams and observed matching `0.925` health-bar fills, a visible player damage overlay, and a lethal-hit game-over state with time paused, controls disabled, two buttons, and an EventSystem.
- The supplied prisoner-hostage FBX and tent FBX/textures import as URP prefabs. Two hostages and the tent are attached to their saved scene markers.
- The health presentation was migrated from sprite-less Filled Images to non-interactable Sliders after gameplay showed that the rectangles stayed visually full. Runtime validation observed both Slider values and fill-rectangle anchors at `0.5` after applying 50 damage.
- Level 1 now has a serialized `Level 1 Objective Controller`: one hostage may follow behind the player at a time, tent contact rescues it, the HUD counts two rescues, Victory pauses gameplay, and Next Level loads `Cutscene_Level2`. A focused Play Mode smoke check exercised the blocked second escort, movement toward the trailing position, both rescues, victory, and the scene transition.
- A restart smoke check confirmed the reloaded Level 1 hides the cursor. The batch Editor cannot retain `CursorLockMode.Locked` without a focused Game view, so final lock-state validation remains a hands-on Editor check; production code requests both lock and hide.
- The Level 1 instruction authoring pass validated a vertical ScrollRect, complete control/objective text, player input gating, and an idempotent enemy start gate. The initial five enemies now spawn only after START MISSION.
- The Level 2 cutscene authoring pass validated seven dialogue commands, the final `PRESS SPACE TO START` mode, and its `Scene_Level2` load target.
- The Level 2 model pass inspected all FBX hierarchies before splitting, generated 40 furniture prefabs plus house/radio/clock prefabs, and validated every prefab has renderers and colliders. The house is 11.05 × 3.41 × 12.81 Unity units with four mesh colliders. All generated materials resolve to supported URP/Lit shaders and their intended base/normal/occlusion textures.
- The Level 1 instruction controller now synchronizes its menu/gameplay cursor state with `StarterAssetsInputs`, preventing focus changes from locking the pointer before START MISSION.
- The Level 2 gameplay authoring pass compiled under Unity 6000.5.0f1 and persisted a model-less CharacterController player, initial-spawn reference, three explicit door/spawn pairs, an Inspector-editable C prompt, and an unscaled-time black fade overlay without rebuilding the user's environment or furniture roots.

## Important constraints and risks

- The senior project uses HDRP 17.5.0, while the remake uses URP 17.5.0. The copied materials were converted to URP Lit, missing material slots were repaired, and two HDRP-only missing components were removed from the copied scene.
- The senior museum scripts use the legacy `UnityEngine.Input` API. Active Input Handling is set to Both; a future rewrite can migrate those scripts fully to the Input System.
- Preserve copied `.meta` files so scene, prefab, model, texture, material, font, and script GUID references remain intact after reorganization.
- Fungus/Amanita references both UGUI and the Input System assemblies. UGUI 2.5.0 is explicitly present in the remake package manifest, and the hierarchy-icon editor integration has a Unity 6000.5 compatibility branch.
- The museum scene is not yet a finished gallery: its current hierarchy contains menu, settings, radio, interaction, and placeholder environment objects.
- The supplied counter-terrorist is rigged but has no usable gameplay animations; its repeated preview/test clips were removed. The first-person body follows player yaw and renders as shadows only.
- The supplied pistol has no source URL or licence in its archive. Treat it as local assignment material until the user supplies the original source and licence.
- The supplied Terrorist model also has no source URL or licence in its archive. Unity reports two source meshes without normals when calculating tangents; the complete character still renders in the validated preview, but the source file should be repaired if normal-mapped materials are added later.
- The local hostage archive is the CC BY 4.0 “Prisoner Hostage Low Poly Character” by 00amza, not the separately supplied KinderKiev URL. The actual imported asset's attribution is recorded in `Assets/Level1/Art/Hostage/SOURCE.md`. The tent is CC BY 4.0 by Arkikon and is recorded in its own source file.
- Level 2 third-party sources and licences are recorded in `Assets/Level2/Art/THIRD_PARTY_SOURCES.md`. Furniture Set 03 is CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, so it must not be used for a commercial release without replacement or separate permission, and share-alike obligations need review before distribution.
