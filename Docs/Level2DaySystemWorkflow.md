# Level 2 Day System

## Player flow

Level 2 begins on Day 1. The player can approach `NextDayClock` in the main lobby and press **C** to end the current day. During the transition:

1. Player movement and camera look are temporarily disabled.
2. A full-screen black day card fades in.
3. The day increases by one.
4. The player returns to `PlayerInitialSpawnPoint`.
5. Scheduled character models update before the card fades out.

The Energy display and negotiation meters are hidden for the full transition and restored after the day card closes. They are also ordered behind documents, conversations, confirmations, and result panels.

The clock stops at Day 6. It does not release the mouse pointer; pointer control remains reserved for future dialogue choices.

Before Day 6 can begin, British Confidence, Delegation Unity, and Public Support must each be above 50. If any meter is 50 or lower, Day 5 remains active and the preparation-failed panel offers a Level 2 restart.

## Daily appointments

| Day | Theme | Recommended destination | Visible character placement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Preparation | Planning Room | Tunku Abdul Rahman at `TunkuAbdulRahman(Day1)` |
| 2 | Internal Security | British Office | Alan Lennox-Boyd at `AlanLennox-Boyd(Day2)` |
| 3 | Finance and Development | British Office | Alan Lennox-Boyd at `AlanLennox-Boyd(Day3)` |
| 4 | The Voice of the People | Radio Station Room | No character model; the radio event will be added later |
| 5 | Defense and Final Position | Planning Room | Tunku Abdul Rahman at `TunkuAbdulRahman(Day5)` |
| 6 | The Constitutional Conference | British Office | Both models at their Day 6 markers |

Each marker contains a scheduled wrapper and a prefab instance. Adjust the wrapper Transform under the marker to fine-tune the character's position, rotation, or scale without changing the shared character prefab.

## Inspector tuning

`Level 2 Gameplay/Level 2 Day System` contains the authoritative `LevelTwoDayController`. Its six briefing titles, appointment text, starting day, fade duration, and day-card hold duration are editable in the Inspector.

The character prefabs are stored in `Assets/Level2/Prefabs/Characters`. Source and licence details are recorded in `Assets/Level2/Art/THIRD_PARTY_SOURCES.md`.

To rebuild only the day system, model prefabs, HUD, and scheduled character wrappers, use **Project Tools > Level 2 > Build Day System and Characters**. The environment, room furniture, door markers, and player prefab are preserved.
